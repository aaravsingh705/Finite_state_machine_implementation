# Finite_state_machine_implementation
Implemented Mealy and Moore machine examples
1. Timer driven traffic light signal - Moore machine example of finite state machine in which i implemented a traffic light with unequal timings of red[5 clock pulses], yellow[2 clock pulses] , green[3 clock pulses].

2. Sequence detector - Mealy machine example of finite state machines in which i implemented a code which detects the presence of 101010 with overlapping in a given sequence.
